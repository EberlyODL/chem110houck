# Try it: Concentration Conversions

Converting between concentration units is a useful skill to be able to make comparisons.

Give the following problems a try before viewing the solution in the video below:

1) What is the molarity of over-the-counter hydrogen peroxide solution, which is 3.0% by mass? The density of the solution is 1.01 g/mL.

2) What is the molarity of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in vinegar, which is 5.0% acetic acid by mass? The density of vinegar is 1.01 g/mL.
