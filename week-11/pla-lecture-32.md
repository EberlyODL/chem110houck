# Concentration of Ions

When ionic salts are dissolved in water, they completely dissociate because they are strong electrolytes.  Sometimes, chemists (and even biologists!) are interested in the concentration of a specific ion or total ion concentration. 

The stoichiometry of the dissolution process determines the concentration of ions in solution.  For example, let's consider when 1 mole of NaCl dissolves in 1 L of water. Since concentration is typically expressed in molarity (M or mol/L), then the concentration of NaCl would be 1 mole NaCl / 1 L = 1 M. NaCl will completely dissociate into Na$$^+$$ and Cl$$^-$$.  Considering stoichiometry (a ratio of quantities), for every one NaCl, you get one Na$$^+$$ cation and one Cl$$^-$$ anion.  
Now let's look at a salt such as $$SrCl_2$$.  If we dissolve 1 mole of $$SrCl_2$$ in 1 L of water, the concentration of $$SrCl_2$$ will again be 1 M.  However, when $$SrCl_2$$ dissociates, one $$Sr^{2+}$$ cation and two $$Cl^-$$ anions are produced.  Using this stoichiometry, one can calculate the $$Cl^-$$ concentration and total ion concentration by the following:
$$[Cl^-] = \frac{1 mol SrCl_2}{1 L} \frac{2 mol Cl^-}{1 mol SrCl_2} = 2 \text{ M } Cl^-$$    
$$[\text{total ion}] = \frac{1 mol SrCl_2}{1 L} \frac{3 \text{mol ions}}{1 mol SrCl_2} = 3 \text{ M } Cl^-$$
