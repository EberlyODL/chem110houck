Lewis structures convey only the connectivity of atoms and placement of electrons.  Using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model, we will be able to predict a molecule's three-dimensional shape.  The shape is important for determining a molecule's polarity, which has a big impact on its physical properties.  A practical application of molecular shape is in drug design.  Drugs are often small molecules that have a specific target in the body.  In order to bind or react with the target, the shape of the molecule has to be just right. 

The particular shape or geometry about an atom is based on the number of groups, known as domains, around a given atom.

There are three key concepts of VSEPR theory.  The first is that electron domains want to be as far from other domains as possible to minimize electron-electron repulsion.  This leads to five basic shapes or electron domain geometries related to the steric number.
