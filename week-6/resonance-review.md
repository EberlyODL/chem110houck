For a review of the patterns to watch for, check out the video below.  The four basic patterns are:
> 1) Lone pairs adjacent to a double (or triple) bond
2) Lone pairs or double bonds adjacent to positive charge
3) Double (or triple) bond between two atoms of differing electronegativities
4) Alternating double-single bonds in a closed ring (i.e. benzene)

When two or more resonance structures exist, then it is necessary to evaluate their relative contribution to the hybrid.  When ranking resonance contributors, consider the following in order:
> 1) The octet is satisfied
2) Formal charge is minimized
3) Electronegative atoms have negative charge and electropositive atoms have positive charge.

If there is no way to differentiate the two structures, they are equivalent.
