For a review of the patterns to watch for, check out the video below.  The four basic patterns are:
1) Lone pairs adjacent to a double (or triple) bond
2) Lone pairs or double bonds adjacent to positive charge
3) Double (or triple) bond between two atoms of differing electronegativities
4) Alternating double-single bonds in a closed ring (i.e. benzene)
