# Types of Solutions

*Note: We will skip over solubility of gases and Henry's Law for now.  Once we discuss gases, we will come back to this.

When solids are mixed in a liquid solvent, three types of solutions are possible depending on how much solute is added. Recall that the solubility of a solute is defined as the maximum amount that can be dissolved in a solvent. Solubility of most compounds increases with increasing temperature.  An _unsaturated_ solution results when there is less than the maximum amount of solute dissolved. This type of solution will appear homogenous.  A _saturated_ solution results when there is more solute than is soluble in the solution.  This solution will be heterogenous; solid in excess of the solubility will remain undissolved on the bottom of the container. A _super saturated_ has more than the maximum amount of solute dissolved.  How is that possible? Well, a super saturated solutions must be prepared by heating it so that all of the solute dissolves, then cooling carefully so that no precipitate forms.

Check out the video below for more details and how to read solubility curves.
