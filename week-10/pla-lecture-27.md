## Phase Diagrams


Phase diagrams are a graph of pressure plotted against temperature. Phase diagrams can give a few useful pieces of information.

> 1) Phase(s) present under specific conditions (temperature and pressure)

> 2) Normal boiling and melting points (when pressure is 1 atm)

> 3) The boiling or melting points at any pressure

> 4) Predict changes in state that may occur with changing temperature and/or pressure
