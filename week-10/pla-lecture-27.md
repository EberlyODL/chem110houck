## Phase Diagrams


Phase diagrams are a graph of pressure plotted against temperature. Pressure is defined as a force per area due to molecular collisions. Atmospheric pressure is the force that gas particles in the atmosphere exert.  The melting and boilign points vary with pressure.  The "normal" melting or boiling point is at a pressure of 1 atm.  As pressure changes, the temperature of the phase change will also change.  Melting is only slightly influenced by changes in pressure and may increase or decrease depending on the substance.  However, the boiling point is significantly impacted by pressure.  The substance vaporizing must exert a pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure in order to boil.  Therefore, at higher pressures (more force), the boiling point will increase.


Phase diagrams can give a few useful pieces of information.

> 1) Phase(s) present under specific conditions (temperature and pressure)

> 2) Normal boiling and melting points (when pressure is 1 atm)

> 3) The boiling or melting points at any pressure

> 4) Predict changes in state that may occur with changing temperature and/or pressure
