## Dissolution Process

Dissolution is the technical term for the process of dissolving a solute into a solvent to form a homogenous solution.  The _solute_ is the minor component and the _solvent_ is the major component of the mixture.  There are many types of solutions, but we will focus on solids in liquids and liquids in liquids for now.

The process of dissolution often involves changes in energy (enthalpy) that can be observed by changes in temperature.  The change in energy comes from the changes in intermolecular forces (IMF) at the atomic level.  Check out the video below for more details!
