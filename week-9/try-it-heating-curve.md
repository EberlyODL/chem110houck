# Try it: Heating Curve Calculations

Data you may need to complete the problems below:
$$C_s$$ (ice) = 2.09 J/(g·K)
$$C_s$$ (liquid) = 4.18 J/(g·K)
$$C_s$$ (steam) = 1.84 J/(g·K)
$$\Delta H_{fus (ice)}$$ = 6.02 kJ/mol
$$\Delta H_{vap (water)}$$ = 40.67 kJ/mol
$$\Delta H_{fus (solid N2)}$$ = 0.72 kJ/mol
$$\Delta H_{vap (liq N2)}$$ = 5.59 kJ/mol

### Problem 2
If you take 5.00 g of grapes that have been frozen with liquid nitrogen and put them in your mouth, how much heat do they absorb as they go from -196 ºC to 37 ºC? Assume that grapes are 100% water.
