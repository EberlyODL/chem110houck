## Stoichiometry

In this lesson, we’re going to learn how to solve stoichiometry problems in which we’re asked to determine the amount of product that will be produced when a certain amount of reactant is consumed in a reaction. The general structure of these problems is that you’ll be given some amount of reactant (either in concentration, mass, moles, or pressure/volume), and you’ll be asked how much product would be produced if that much reactant were consumed in a reaction. The problem will usually specify whether you should specify the answer in grams, moles, or some other form. As a general strategy, you should start these problems by converting whatever is given in the problem in the moles - get on the mole train!!!! Then you can use the stoichiometric coefficients given in the balanced reaction equation to determine the number of moles of product that are produced. Then the moles of product can be converted into whatever form is requested in the question. This is depicted in the scheme in Figure 1, in which "moles" are the means of communication between reactants and products, and once we have moles we can convert directly to and from concentration (if we know the total volume), mass (using molecular weight), and PV (using the ideal gas law at a given temperature).

## Theoretical Yield

In class, we were about to calculate the amount of $$CO_2$$ produced from the combustion of 1 gallon of gasoline.  See this problem solved below.  The reaction takes place in excess oxygen (since there is plenty in the atmosphere!).  The amount of $$CO_2$$ that we calculate is known as the theoretical yield.

# Limiting Reactant

Sometimes we will have reactions where it is not clear which reactant is in excess. In these cases, we will need to calculate what is known as the limiting reactant.  In the video below I summarize the definitions and do an example calculation.


We will apply these concepts in lecture on Friday to a variety of problems.
