# Intro to Chemical Reactions

In the upcoming lessons we’re going to begin to explore chemical reactions. During a chemical reaction, bonds and lone pairs are redistributed among the substances involved in the reaction. In order words, bonds are broken and formed during reactions, and electrons are rearranged among the structures of the reactants.

Mass is conserved during chemical reactions, meaning that no matter is created or destroyed during the reaction. The identities of all atoms involved remain the same \(i.e., the nuclei do not change during a chemical reaction\). Therefore, the number of atoms of each element involved in the reaction must be equal in both the products and reactants.

Chemical reactions can be described using a reaction equation like the one presented in Figure 1. The reaction equation identifies the reactants \(on the left side of the arrow\) and the products of the reaction \(on the right side of the arrow\). Each molecular formula in the reaction equation is preceded by a coefficient that identifies the number of moles of each substance that are involved in the reaction. For example, the combustion of ethane involves the reaction of two moles of ethane \($$C_2H_6$$\) with seven moles of oxygen to produce four moles of carbon dioxide and six moles of water, as shown in the reaction equation. If no coefficient is shown in front of a molecular formula then the coefficient is assumed to be one. This equation is said to be balanced because the same number of each type of element appears on both sides of the reaction equation. Notice that there are 4 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 14 oxygen atoms on both the reactant \(left\) and product \(right\) sides of the reaction equation.

As we will see in class, some reactions are driven by the formation of a solid precipitate from a solution. In order to determine which substances will precipitate we need to be familiar with the solubility trends for common ionic substances. Substances that are soluble in water will not form precipitates, whereas substances that are insoluble will form precipitates.

The top portion of Table 1 describes substances that are soluble, along with a few exceptions. Ionic compounds in which the cation is $$NH_4^+$$, $$Li^+$$, $$Na^+$$, $$K^+$$, $$Rb^+$$, or $$Cs^+$$ will always be soluble, with no exceptions \(i.e., the identity of the anion doesn’t matter\). Similarly, ionic compounds in which the anion is nitrate \($$NO_3^-$$\), perchlorate \($$ClO_4^-$$\), or acetate \($$CH_3COO^-$$\) will always be soluble, with no exceptions \(i.e., the identity of the cation doesn’t matter\). These soluble anions and cations share the common property that they are relatively large and singly charged and, as you would expect from Coulomb’s law, only form weak interactions with any counter ion. Ionic compounds in which the anion is chloride \($$Cl^-$$\), bromide \($$Br^-$$\), or iodide \($$I^-$$\) are soluble unless the cation is mercury\(I\) \($$Hg_2^{2+}$$\), silver \($$Ag^+$$\), or lead \($$Pb^{2+}$$\). For example, aluminum chloride \($$AlCl_3$$\) would be soluble, but silver chloride \(AgCl\) would not be soluble. Ionic compounds in which the anion is sulfate \($$SO_4^{2-}$$\) are usually soluble unless the cation is $$Ca^{2+}, Sr^{2+}, Ba^{2+}, Hg_2^{2+}, Ag^+, \text{or } Pb^{2+}$$.

The bottom part of Table 1 describes substances that are insoluble, along with a few exceptions. Ionic compounds in which the anion is carbonate \($$CO_3^{2-}$$\) or phosphate \($$PO_4^{3-}$$\) are insoluble unless the cation is one of those we listed earlier whose salts are always soluble \($$NH_4^+, Li^+, Na^+, K^+, Rb^+, \text{or }Cs^+$$\). Ionic compounds in which the anion is hydroxide \($$OH^-$$\) or sulfide \($$S^{2-}$$\) are also insoluble unless the cation is $$NH_4^+, Li^+, Na^+, K^+, Rb^+, Cs^+, Ca^{2+}, Sr^{2+}, \text{or }Ba^{2+}$$ \(the “always soluble” cations we listed earlier, plus a couple more\).

If two solutions are mixed together that contain an insoluble cation/anion pair, then the pair of ions will react and form an ionic solid that will precipitate from the solution. For example, If a solution of ammonium sulfate is mixed with a solution of barium chloride, the barium ions and sulfate ions will react to form solid barium sulfate. Ammonium chloride, however, is soluble, so the ammonium and chloride ions would not form a precipitate and would instead remained dissolved in the solution as spectator ions.
