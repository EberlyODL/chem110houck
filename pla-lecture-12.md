It's important to note that bonding does not simply occur to satisfy some empirical rules.  _Atoms form bonds to reach a lower energy. When a bond forms, energy will be released ($$\Delta$$E < 0)._
Filled-shell noble gas configurations are especially stable due to their perfectly spherical distribution of electron density.  In order to achieve a noble gas configuration, atoms must gain, lose, or share electrons.  Most atoms want to achieve an "octet" where there are eight electrons in its valence shell.
As we will see in the following sections, there are two types of bonds: ionic and covalent. In ionic bonds, ions with noble gas configurations and opposite charges are attracted to one another and come together to form ionic solids.  In covalent bonds, electrons are shared between atoms.  These electrons are attracted to both nuclei simultaneously. 

For a recap of identifying valence electrons in an atom and an overview of drawing Lewis structures of main group elements, check out the video below!  (Note: You do not need to be able to draw Lewis dot structures for transition metals.)

## Ionic Bonding

Ionic bonding results from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, thus ionic compounds always consist of positive and negative ions. Ionic compounds are almost always combinations of metals and nonmetals. An example is Sodium fluoride (NaF), a combination of a metal (sodium) and a nonmetal (fluorine) (from the left and right sides of the periodic table, respectively). Similarly, potassium sulfate (K$$_2$$SO$$_4$$) contains both a metal (potassium) and two nonmetals (sulfur and oxygen). Ammonium chloride (NH$$_4$$Cl), is one of the few exceptions to the “metal-nonmetal” trend. Ammonium chloride consists of the positive ammonium ion (NH$$_4^+$$) and the negative chloride ion (Cl$$^-$$), as such, this compound is an ionic compound even though it consists only of nonmetals. Ionic compounds tend to exist as extended networks of atoms (rather than as discrete molecules). These compounds form extended lattices (where the cation and anion repeat over and over again) and they tend to be brittle and have high melting points.
