# Solubility of Gases



We will revisit section 14.4 in the ebook relating to the solubility of gases.  The solubility of a gas in a solution is affected by the pressure. Pressure does not, however, affect the solubility of liquids and solids in solutions. 


The solubility of a dissolved gas is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas ($$P_g$$) above the solution. This relationship is known as Henry’s Law, which is $$C_g=kP_g$$, where $$C_g$$ is the concentration (i.e., solubility) of a gas (“g” is the identity of the gas), $$P_g$$ is the partial pressure of the gas, and k is the proportionality constant. The proportionality constant (k) varies from one gas to the next, and its value is related to the strength of IMFs that the gas can form with the solvent. Gases that form stronger IMFs with water will have larger Henry’s law constants, thus larger amounts of these gases will dissolve at a fixed partial pressure compared to weak IMF gases. In other words gases with stronger IMFs will be more soluble in water. This is shown by the graph on in Figure 1. The graph plots solubility versus partial pressure of the gas, with each line representing a different gas. The slope of the line, which equals the Henry’s law constant, is larger for gases that form stronger IMFs. 

Henry’s law explains why carbonated beverages release large amounts of gas when they’re opened. These beverages are packaged with pressurized carbon dioxide, with a typical can of soda having an airspace consisting of $$CO_2$$ at a partial pressure of 1.5-2.0 atm. Under this high partial pressure, the $$CO_2$$ is quite soluble in the beverage. When the soda is opened, however, the airspace in the can (which was previously pressurized $$CO_2$$) is replaced with air at about 1 atm total pressure. Air only contains a tiny amount of $$CO_2$$, so the partial pressure of $$CO_2$$ goes from 1.5-2.0 atm to nearly zero. As such, the solubility of $$CO_2$$ in the soda decreases dramatically upon opening, resulting in a supersaturated solution. Since CO2 is supersaturated in the opened soda we observe a net movement (in the form of bubbles and fizz) of gas out of the beverage.
