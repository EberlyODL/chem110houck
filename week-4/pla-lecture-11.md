We know all about the structure of atoms and how electrons are arranged.  Now, we will begin looking at how we can rearrange electrons to form chemical bonds.  Chemical bonds hold atoms together forming compounds.  

If you would like a refresher on how atoms differ from compounds, please see the video on the right.

In this unit we will expand on the concept of bonding and learn about some finer details of molecular structure.  Like atoms, molecules can be counted by mass.  The molar mass of a compound is the mass of 1 mole of a substance.  It can be calculated by adding the molar mass of each individual atom present.

Let's use aspirin as an example.  The common analgesic has a molecular formula of $$C_9H_8O_4$$.  The molecular formula tells you exactly how many and what type of atoms are present in a molecule.  To calculate the molar mass, we would carry out the following calculation:
> $$\text{molar mass} = (9\text{ mol C atoms})(12.011\text{ g/mol C})+(8 \text{ mol H atoms})(1.008 \text{ g/mol H})+(4 \text{ mol O atoms})(15.999 \text{ g/mol O})$$ 
> $$\text{molar mass} = 180.157 \text{ g/mol}$$ 

The mass of a substance can be converted to moles by dividing the mass by the molar mass.  Similarly, the number of moles of a substance can be converted to grams by miultiplying the moles by the molar mass.

The number of moles of a substance can be multiplied by Avogadro's number ($$N_A$$) to determine how many molecules are present.  Similarly, you can divide the number of molecules by $$N_A$$ to determine the number of moles that are present.

**Example:**
How many aspirin molecules are in a 325 mg dose of aspirin?
> $$325\text{ mg}(\frac{1\text{ g}}{1000\text{ mg}})(\frac{1\text{ mol}}{180.157\text{ g}})(\frac{6.022\times10^{23}\text{ molecules}}{1\text{ mol}}) = 1.09\times10^{21} \text{molecules}$$ 


An extension of this concept is calculating the number of atoms of a particular type in a compound.   

**Example:**
How many carbon atoms are in a 325 mg dose of aspirin?

The first 3 steps of the calculation are the same as above.  The 4th step is to use the mole ratio.  The mole ratio tells how many atoms per molecule there are and is determined from the molecular formula.  Aspirin has 9 carbon atoms per molecule and can be written as $$\frac{9\text{ C atoms}}{1\text{ molecule}}$$ (or the reciprocal).


> $$325\text{ mg}(\frac{1\text{ g}}{1000\text{ mg}})(\frac{1\text{ mol}}{180.157\text{ g}})(\frac{6.022\times10^{23}\text{ molecules}}{1\text{ mol}})(\frac{9\text{ C atoms}}{1\text{ molecule}}) = 9.78\times10^{21} \text{C atoms}$$

# Percent Composition

The percent composition describes the mass percentage of each element in a compound.  First, the mass percentage of an element will equal the ratio of the mass of an element in a sample to the total mass of the sample as equation 1 shows below. 

> 1) $$\text{mass % element} = \frac{\text{mass of element in sample}}{\text{ total mass of sample}}\times 100 \text%$$

As an example, if a 100.0 gram sample of aspirin contains 60.0 grams of carbon, we can use this equation to calculate the mass percentage (or percent composition) of carbon in aspirin: 


$$\text{% Carbon} = \frac{60.0 \text { g carbon}}{100 \text{ g aspirin}}\times 100 \text% = 60.0 \text{% carbon in aspirin}$$ 


Equation 2 describes the mass percentage of an element in a compound as equaling the number of atoms of that element in the compound, times the atomic weight of the element, divided by the molecular weight of the compound. 

> 2) $$\text{mass %} = \frac{(\text{# atoms of an element}) ( \text{molecular weight of element})}{\text{molecular weight of compound}}\times 100\text{%}$$



If I wanted to calculate the mass percentage of oxygen in aspirin, I could do so as follows:

$$\text{% Oxygen} = \frac{4 \text{ O atoms} \times 15.999 \text{ g/mol}}{180.157 \text{ g/mol}}\times 100\text{%} = 35.522\text{% oxygen in aspirin}$$

Finally, all of the mass percentages in a compound must total 100%. Therefore, I can calculate the mass percentage of hydrogen in aspirin now that I know the mass percentages of carbon and oxygen: 

$$\text{% Hydrogen} = 100\text{%} - 60.0\text{%} - 35.522\text{%}= 4.5\text{% hydrogen in aspirin}$$

Alternatively we could have solved for the mass percentage of hydrogen using the same equation that we used for oxygen. We would have gotten the same answer.
