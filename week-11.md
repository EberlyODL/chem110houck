# Vapor Pressure

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Define vapor pressure and describe how temperature and intermolecular forces influence vapor pressure.

* Define the normal boiling point and predict the effect of external pressure on the boiling point of a liquid.



Vapor pressure, like boiling point and $$\Delta H_{vap}$$, depends on the strength of intermolecular forces (IMF) present between particles.  Vapor pressure defined as the pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase in a sealed container at a given temperature.  Essentially, some molecules at the surface in a liquid (or solid) will have enough energy to "escape" to the gas phase.  This vapor exerts a pressure known as the vapor pressure.  (Pressure is a force caused by molecular collisions and we will explore pressure more in Chapter 12.)
