# Light Energy Try it!

Give these problems a try.  A full solution is given in the video at the bottom of the page.  

A laser emits green light with a wavelength of 523 nm:

1. What is the energy of one photon from this laser? 

2. What is the energy of 1 mole of these photons?

3. If the laser emits 1.30 x 10$$^{-2}$$ J of energy during a pulse, how many photons are emitted during the pulse? 

Useful constants and equations from your [equation sheet](https://media.ed.science.psu.edu/sites/media/ed/files/documents/110-data.pdf) (available on exams):
* c = λν
* c = 3.00 x 10$$^8$$ m/s
* $$N_A$$ = 6.022 x 10$$^{23}$$ 
* E$$_{photon}$$ = hν
* h = 6.626 × 10$$^{−34}$$ J*s
