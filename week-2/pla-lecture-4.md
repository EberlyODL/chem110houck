## Enthalpy

In class, we looked at energy transfer in the form of heat and work.  Enthalpy ($$\Delta$$H) is equal to heat (q) at constant pressure.  Under conditions where pressure is constant and our system does not undergo changes in volume, enthalpy is equal to internal energy.  Enthalpy is easily measured experimentally (we will study calorimetry at the end of the term) and is a common quantity you will see.
When heat _exits_ a system (loses heat), we define that as _exothermic_.  When heat _enters_ a system (gains heat), we define the process as _endothermic_. Let's look at an example you are familiar with.  When your body sweats, the sweat will evaporate from your skin.  Thinking of the sweat as the system, you have to put energy in for evaporation to take place.  As a result, heat was transferred from the surroundings (your body) and you feel cooler!
In a similar way, if you were to place your arm over a pot of boiling water, the water vapor (gas) would condense on your skin.  This process would cause heat to exit the system (water molecules) and release heat to the surroundings (you!) likely causing a burn (ouch!).

## Electrostatic Potential Energy

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able to…_

* Define electrostatic potential energy and apply Coulomb's Law to rank the overall electrostatic energy, and the strength of attraction for different interacting charges.


So far, we have been examining the transfer of kinetic energy in the forms of heat and work.  Now, let's look at potential energy. Electrostatic potential energy is the potential (stored) energy associated with the position of charged particles. When two particles separated by an infinite distance, $$E_{el}=0$$ because there is no interaction between them.  We are likely familiar with the idea that opposite charges attract. In this scenario, $$E_{el} < 0$$, (negative) because the system (the charges) will do work to bring them closer together.    
For like charges, $$E_{el}$$ > 0.  The surroundings must do work _on_ the system to bring those particles closer together.
According to Coulomb's law, $$E_{el}$$ depends on the magnitude of charge and the distance separating the particles. 

> $$E_{el}= \frac{Q_1Q_2}d$$

In this mathematical representation, you can easily see how changes in charge and distance will affect $$E_{el}$$. (Don't forget that as a number gets more negative, it is actually getting smaller!)

## Characteristics of Light

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able to…_

* Define wavelength, frequency, and photon energy, and explore the relationship between wavelength and frequency, between energy and wavelength, and between energy and frequency.
* Recognize the ranges of wavelength of different regions in the electromagnetic spectrum and rank the relative order of wavelength (frequency, photon energy) of different regions in electromagnetic spectrum.
* Rank the relative order of colors and range of wavelength in the visible spectrum.

Light is the final form of energy that we will study.  Light behaves like a wave. In fact, light consists of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that propagate (travel) through space. Since light is a wave, you can think of it as having a wavelength and an amplitude. The wavelength (abbreviated as lower-case Greek letter lambda, λ) of a wave describes the distance between two peaks in the wave. The amplitude of a wave is related to its intensity (the height of a peak). We will work with wavelength throughout the course, but won’t deal with amplitude again. 

Waves can also be described in terms of frequency. The frequency of a wave is a measure of the number of peaks that pass by a particular point in space per unit time. The units for measuring frequency are inverse seconds (s$$^{-1}$$), which equals Hertz (Hz). Frequency is abbreviated using the lower-case Greek letter nu (ν).

All light waves move at the same speed in a vacuum (i.e., empty space). This speed is a fundamental constant which is abbreviated with a lower-case c. The speed of light is equal to about 3.0 x 10$$^8$$ m/s. The speed of light is equal to the product of a light wave’s wavelength (λ) in meters and frequency (ν) in s$$^{-1}$$; therefore c=λν (in m/s). An important consequence of this relationship is that the wavelength of a light wave is inversely proportional to its frequency. In other words, as wavelength increases, frequency decreases (and vice versa). 

Shown below are the different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Where a particular type of light falls on the spectrum depends on its wavelength and frequency. The boundary between each region of the spectrum can be a bit fuzzy, and these regions are characterized mostly by how light within that region interacts with matter (Table 1). The study of light and its interaction with matter is  a field known as spectroscopy.

**Table 1: How light interacts with matter**

| Type of radiation | $$\lambda$$ unit | Interaction with matter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| radio | kilometer \(km), meter (m) | Flip nuclear spin |
| microwave | centimeter (cm), millimeter (mm) | Causes molecular rotations |
| infrared (IR) | micrometer \($$\mu$$m) | Causes molecular vibrations |
| visible | nanometer (nm) | electronic transitions |
| ultraviolet | nanometer (nm) | electronic transitions, can break certain chemical bonds |
| X-rays | Angstrom (Å) | ionizing radiation \(ejection of electrons\) |
| gamma rays | Angstrom (Å) | ionizing radiation \(ejection of electrons\) |
(Note: You don’t need to memorize these details, but you should be familiar with them.) 


You’ll need to know the different regions of the spectrum as well as their relative order: radio, microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays (in order of decreasing wavelength and increasing frequency). 

You’ll also need to know the relative order of the regions of the visible spectrum. A convenient acronym is ROYGBIV (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), which lists the regions of the visible spectrum in order of decreasing wavelength and increasing frequency.
