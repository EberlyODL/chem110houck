## Standard States for Elements

In order to use $$\Delta H ^\circ _f$$ values and in order to recognize when $$\Delta H ^\circ _f$$ = $$\Delta H ^\circ _{rxn}$$ we need to be able to determine whether an element is in its most stable form at standard state. All metals and metalloids are solids at standard state except for mercury (Hg), which is a liquid. Noble gases (group 8) are all monatomic gases. Several elements exist as diatomic species at standard state, these include group 7 ($$F_2, Cl_2, Br_2, \text{and }I_2$$) plus hydrogen ($$H_2$$), nitrogen ($$N_2$$), and oxygen ($$O_2$$). All of these diatomic species are gases at standard state except for $$Br_2$$ (liquid) and $$I_2$$ (solid). All other nonmetals are solids. 

It is worth noting that for carbon the most stable form is graphite (versus diamond). Graphite should be familiar, as it is the substance used to make pencil lead.
