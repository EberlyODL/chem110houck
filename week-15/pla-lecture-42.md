## Hess's Law

In the upcoming lecture we will introduce two strategies for calculating heats of reaction. The first of these is Hess’s Law, which states that the overall ΔH for any process is equal to the sum of the individual enthalpy changes for each step in the process. Figure 1 shows two hypothetical processes, the conversion of A to B with enthalpy change $$\Delta H_1$$ and the conversion of B to C with enthalpy change $$\Delta H_2$$. If we know the values of $$\Delta H_1$$ and $$\Delta H_2$$ we can use Hess’s Law to calculate ΔH for the conversion of A to C. If we add the two processes together (as shown on the slide) we produce the reaction: $$A + B \longrightarrow B + C$$. Since B is on both sides of the reaction we can simplify this to $$A \longrightarrow C$$. Since this reaction is the sum of two other reactions, its overall enthalpy change (let’s call it $$\Delta H_3$$) equals the $$\Delta H_1$$ + $$\Delta H_2$$, the sum of the enthalpy changes for its component steps. 

Hess’s Law works because enthalpy is a state function and is thus not path dependent. In this example it doesn’t matter which path is taken when A is converted to C, the enthalpy change will always be the same, regardless of whether B is formed as an intermediate during the process.

## Heat of formation

We will also use enthalpies of formation ($$\Delta H ^\circ _f$$) to calculate heat of reaction values. The enthalpy of formation (also called heat of formation) for a compound is the heat that is given off (or absorbed) when **elements** combine to form **one mole** of a compound. These values allow us to compare energy changes on a common scale using elements in their most stable form as a reference. Enthalpies of formation ($$\Delta H ^\circ _f$$) are measured at standard state (P = 1 atm and T = 25°C) with each reactant in its most stable form under those conditions. The “°” denotes a value at standard state. Note that the temperature associated with standard state is different from the temperature associated STP that we introduced when we discussed gases. 

Shown below is an example in which carbon (as graphite, carbon’s most stable elemental form at standard state) reacts with diatomic oxygen gas (oxygen’s most stable elemental form at standard state) to form one mole of carbon dioxide gas. The value of $$\Delta H ^\circ _{rxn}$$ for this reaction is -393.5 kJ. Since this reaction produces one mole of carbon dioxide from its component elements in their most stable states, $$\Delta H ^\circ _{rxn}$$ for this reaction equals $$\Delta H ^\circ _{f}$$ for $$CO_2$$ (g).

$$C_{(graphite)} + O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow CO_{2(g)} \Delta H ^\circ _{rxn} = -393.5 \text{ kJ} $$

It is worth noting that ΔH°f for any element in its most stable state is equal to zero because the reactants and products would be the same any such a reaction. 

## Standard States for Elements

In order to use $$\Delta H ^\circ _f$$ values and in order to recognize when $$\Delta H ^\circ _f$$ = $$\Delta H ^\circ _{rxn}$$ we need to be able to determine whether an element is in its most stable form at standard state. All metals and metalloids are solids at standard state except for mercury (Hg), which is a liquid. Noble gases (group 8) are all monatomic gases. Several elements exist as diatomic species at standard state, these include group 7 ($$F_2, Cl_2, Br_2, \text{and }I_2$$) plus hydrogen ($$H_2$$), nitrogen ($$N_2$$), and oxygen ($$O_2$$). All of these diatomic species are gases at standard state except for $$Br_2$$ (liquid) and $$I_2$$ (solid). All other nonmetals are solids. 

It is worth noting that for carbon the most stable form is graphite (versus diamond). Graphite should be familiar, as it is the substance used to make pencil lead.
