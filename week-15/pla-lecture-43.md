## Bond Dissociation Energy

The final estimation of $$\Delta H _{rxn}$$ uses bond dissociation energy (BDE) values to estimate $$\Delta H _{rxn}$$ given the number and type of bonds that are broken and formed during the process. As we saw earlier in the semester, bond dissociation energy is the enthalpy that must be absorbed for a bond to in a molecule to break in the gas phase. In our e-book you can find lists of BDE values for a variety of bonds. For example, if you look up the BDE for an H-H single bond, you’ll see that this bond has a bond dissociation energy of 436 kJ/mol. That means that a mole of $$H_2$$ in the gas phase would need to absorb 436 kJ of energy in order for the H-H bond to break.

For an H-H bond there is only one molecule, $$H_2$$, that contains this bond. Thus, measuring the BDE of an H-H bond is straightforward. Measuring BDE values becomes more complicated for more molecules with more than two atoms. Take the O-H bond, for example. O-H bonds can be found in a variety of molecules, such as water, alcohols, carboxylic acids, etc. In each of those contexts, the BDE of the O-H bond differs slightly. The scheme below shows the example of water, in which we see that the BDE for the first O-H bond is actually different than the BDE for the second O-H bond. The breaking the first bond in water requires a little energy because it forms an unstable odd electron species, while the second was a little lower because we broke an unstable odd electron species. 

$$H-O-H_{(g)}  \longrightarrow H-O_{(g)} + H_{(g)} \Delta H_{rxn} = 494 kJ/mol $$

$$H-O_{(g)} \longrightarrow O_{(g)} + H_{(g)} \Delta H_{rxn} = 424 kJ/mol $$

If you look up the BDE of an O-H bond in the literature you’ll find a value of 463 kJ/mol. This value is an average of BDE values for a variety of O-H bonds from a range of molecules. Because BDE values are obtained in this way, they are not exactly accurate for any one case, and thus when we use these values to predict $$\Delta H _{rxn}$$ our results will not be exactly accurate either. That said, using BDE values to estimate $$\Delta H _{rxn}$$ does provide a pretty good approximation in most situations. 

We can use BDE values to estimate ΔHrxn for any overall reaction. Chemical reactions involve the making of chemical bonds (ΔH < 0) and the breaking of chemical bonds (ΔH > 0). Thus we can estimate ΔHrxn by adding together the enthalpies of the bonds that are broken and subtracting from it the enthalpies of the bonds that are formed.

The example below shows the reaction of ethane ($$C_2H_6$$) with chlorine ($$Cl_2$$) to form two moles of chloromethane ($$CH_3Cl$$). 

$$CH_3CH_{3(g)} + Cl_{2(g)} \longrightarrow 2 CH_3Cl_{(g)} \Delta H_{rxn} = ??? $$

During the course of this reaction the C-C bond in ethane breaks, the Cl-Cl bond in chlorine breaks, and two new C-Cl bonds form. Thus, we can estimate $$\Delta H_{rxn}$$ for this reaction as follows:

ΔHrxn = ($$BDE_{C-C}$$) + ($$BDE_{Cl-Cl}$$) – (2)($$BDE_{C-Cl}$$)

The “2” in front of the C-Cl BDE comes from the fact that two of these bonds are being formed. The negative sign in from of the C-Cl BDE comes from the fact that these bonds are being formed (and thus enthalpy is decreasing). The other terms are positive since those bonds are being broken (and thus enthalpy is increasing).
