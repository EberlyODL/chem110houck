## Structure of an Atom

Before we dive into the content, I will explain the structure of each PLA page.  Links to the ebook readings are available in the upper right corner of most pages.  Sometimes there are multiple lessons/videos that correspond to a section of the ebook, so each time you encounter one of those buttons, you know you are starting a new topic.
Learning objectives for each page are also noted at the top.  You should check back with the learning objectives after you have completed the lesson to be sure you can meet each one.
The text included on each page is intended to be brief and provide some context or connection from one topic to another.  Since you already have a textbook, I won't write you another one! :)
The video within each page is usually 5-10 minutes long and covers a topic in the text.  I encourage you to take notes during the videos as you would if you were attending a lecture.  The nice thing about videos is that you can rewind if you miss something! Some videos will stop and pop up with questions for you to try.  There is no penalty for wrong answers, so give it your best shot.  


**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* describe the subatomic particles that make up an atom.
* use the periodic table to determine the numbers of protons and electrons in a neutral (uncharged) atom.


Matter, anything that has mass and takes up space, is made of atoms. This lesson explores the structure of an atom and the subatomic particles within: protons, neutrons, and electrons.
