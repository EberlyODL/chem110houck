## Structure of an Atom

Before we dive into the content, I will explain the structure of each PLA page.  Links to the ebook readings are available in the upper right corner of most pages.  Sometimes there are multiple lessons/videos that correspond to a section of the ebook, so each time you encounter one of those buttons, you know you are starting a new topic.
Learning objectives for each page are also noted at the top.  You should check back with the learning objectives after you have completed the lesson to be sure you can meet each one.
The text included on each page is intended to be brief and provide some context or connection from one topic to another.  Since you already have a textbook, I won't write you another one! :)
The video within each page is usually 5-10 minutes long and covers a topic in the text.  I encourage you to take notes during the videos as you would if you were attending a lecture.  The nice thing about videos is that you can rewind if you miss something! Some videos will stop and pop up with questions for you to try.  There is no penalty for wrong answers, so give it your best shot.  


**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* describe the subatomic particles that make up an atom.
* use the periodic table to determine the numbers of protons and electrons in a neutral (uncharged) atom.
* calculate average atomic weights from isotopic weights and natural abundances
* solve for isotope mass or abundance given average atomic weight

Matter, anything that has mass and takes up space, is made of atoms. This lesson explores the structure of an atom and the subatomic particles within: protons, neutrons, and electrons.

## Isotopes and Atomic Mass

An atom's identity is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus. As an example, let's look at carbon (an organic chemist's favorite!). Carbon has an atomic number of 6 and will have 6 protons. However, not all carbon atoms are identical. The number of neutrons in the nucleus can vary; carbon typically has 6, 7, or 8 neutrons. Atoms that have the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons are known as isotopes. For carbon, 98.93% of carbon atoms have 6 neutrons (known as carbon-12 or $$^{12}$$C for having 12 particles in the nucleus) and only 1.07% of carbon atoms have 7 neutrons (carbon-13 or $$^{13}$$C). (Carbon-14 has an abundance that is effectively 0%.)
The number of isotopes and their abundance for a given element varies. Like the proton, a neutron has mass, so the mass of each isotope will be different and is known as the isotopic mass. The average atomic mass that you see on the periodic table is calculated by using the abundance and isotopic mass. Since there is so much more carbon-12 than carbon-13, one would expect the mass to be much closer to 12 than 13. In fact, it is 12.01 amu.

In class, we will do an example problem on solving isotope abundance and move into ions and molecules as well as the mole.
