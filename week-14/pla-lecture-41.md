# Calorimetry

As we have seen already, calorimetry is the experimental measure of heat flow. Calorimetry can be used to measure the heat that is absorbed or released during a chemical reaction based on the change in temperature that results from the reaction. Surprisingly, a simple “coffee cup” calorimeter can be used to conduct calorimetry experiments. In this experimental set up, a liquid is contained within an insulated container like a styrofoam cup. A reaction takes place inside the container and the change in temperature that takes place during the reaction is recorded with a thermometer. Because the container is insulated, any heat that is released or absorbed by the reactants is absorbed by or lost from the liquid in the container, changing its temperature. Modern laboratory equipment, of course, is more sophisticated than the simple coffee cup, allowing for better insulation of the contents of the container, and thus more accurate heat of reaction measurements.
