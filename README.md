# Skills Check Overview
Welcome to CHEM 110! We will begin the semester with a brief, self-paced review of a few basic skills from previous courses that you'll need in order to be successful. This review module contains five sections in which you will practice the skills listed below:

**Algebra**

* Manipulate and solve algebraic expressions involving exponents, radicals, and fractions.
* Substitute values in place of variables to solve equations.

**Metric Units**

* Convert from one metric unit to another.
* Connect metric units to real-world situations.

**Scientific Notation and Significant Figures**

* Use scientific notation to express large and small numbers.
* Round to the appropriate number of significant digits when performing calculations.

**Density and Dimensional Analysis**

* Use density to relate mass and volume.
* Use dimensional analysis to relate physical quantities.

**Naming Chemical Compounds**

* Identify the names and chemical formulas of ions, polyatomic ions, and chemical substances.

Each of the five sections will have the same basic structure and features a web page that provides review material as well as two quizzes. The first quiz will be titled "Part A". The second quiz will be titled "Part B". Both quizzes contain the same number of questions and have the same time limit. Both quizzes also draw from the same bank of test questions. The only difference between the two quizzes is that you can attempt Part A as many times as you like, with only your highest score counting towards your grade. In contrast, you may only attempt Part B a maximum of three times (only your highest score counts). The intent is for you to practice by taking Part A several times, and then once you're confident that you've mastered the material, you should take Part B. 

Each of the five sections contains a Part A quiz and a Part B quiz, for a total of ten quizzes in all. Each of the ten quizzes will count equally towards your Skills Check grade (i.e., you must complete BOTH the Part A quizzes and the Part B quizzes to receive full credit). A survey is available for extra credit at the end of the review. Your overall Skills Check grade counts for total of 2% of your final course grade. All of assignments in the Skills Check are due on September 3rd at 11:59pm.

You are encouraged to use a calculator and periodic table on these quizzes. You will get the most out of the review if you avoid using other outside resources (such as text books or the internet) when solving quiz questions. These quizzes review skills that you need in order to be successful in CHEM 110, and you are doing yourself a disservice if you move on without mastering them.

Since we assume that you've previously seen this material, the review web page that accompanies each pair of quizzes is not comprehensive. If you need additional review material, you're encouraged to seek out reading from other sources (such as from the e-book, the internet, or other textbooks). You're also encouraged to ask your instructor, your TA, or the LAs if you have any questions. This review is intended to be a learning experience, not a source of stress, so please let us know if you get stuck! :)
