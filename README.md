# Course Orientation

What is a course orientation? Do I really need this?

Sure! It can't hurt! Are you really ready to learn online? Take this [Online Learning Readiness Questionnaire](/weblearning.psu.edu/questionnaire/ORQ.HTM).

Consider how, generally speaking, online learning differs in some key respects from traditional face-to-face learning:



| **Face-to-face Characteristic** | **Online characteristic** | **Key difference** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primarily instructor-managed | Primarily student-managed | Increased student responsibility to actively manage the pace,effort, and progress in learning |
| Synchronous | Asynchronous | Instructor and student are usually not online at the same time \(and may be separated by one or more time zones\) |
| Scheduled time and place | No scheduled time and place | Online is more flexible but the familiar structure of class meetings is missing |
| Spontaneous, instant clarification and discussion | Planned instruction with less immediate feedback and dialog | Face-to-face explanation is easy, immediate, and regular,but questions, feedback, and grading take longer online |
| Naturally strong instructor presence; sense of learning in a familiar group | The student must work harder to establish rapport with the instructor and other students | The online student often feels less connected, even isolated |
| May rely more on listening and speaking than reading and writing | Relies heavily on a student's abilities to read and write well | Nearly all dynamic interaction\(unplanned dialog\)between an instructor and student will be text-based, requiring careful reading and clear writing |
| Less reliance on the reliability of technology used | Technology reliability is critical | Loss of Internet connectivity,slow media playback, recurring browser crashes, or many other difficulties can stop all progress until resolved |


In this orientation you will: 

* Review the syllabus closely for course requirements, due dates, policies, and the like
* Ensure that you can locate and access all course content and play all media
* Clarify what is expected of you as a student and what you may reasonably expect from your instructor
* Receive answers to many questions you likely have
* "Meet" your instructor by attending a course meeting.
* Reckon with the nature of online learning, both positive and negative aspects
