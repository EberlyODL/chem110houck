## Orbital Energies

We know that an orbital is an address to describe the location of an electron within an atom.  We are familiar with orbital characteristics such as shapes, sizes, number of nodes, etc.  Now, let's take a look at their energies.  Atoms strive to achieve the lowest energy possible - after all, that's what drives all of the processes around us.  We will soon be able to determine the  true structure of an atom by electron configuration.

## Effective Nuclear Charge

The fact that energy level splitting occurs in a multi-electron atom is rooted in Coulomb's Law and the concepts of shielding and penetration.  Imagine a light bulb as a nucleus and a lampshade as a shell (i.e. n = 1).  If you place a shell over the nucleus, an electron on the outside of the shell will feel less attraction from the nucleus just as an observer sees less light from the bulb due to the shade.  Effective nuclear charge is the idea that an electron will feel less of the nuclear charge if it is shielded by other electrons.

## Electron Spin

Is there a limit to the number of electrons that an orbital can contain? The answer is, "Yes!"
The discovery of the fourth quantum number had implications on how electrons could be arranged in an atom.  Unlike the other three quantum numbers, the spin quantum number, $$m_s$$, is a characteristic of a specific electron rather than a spacial location.  Each electron has a quantized spin that is related to the direction of its magnetic dipole.  The possible values are $$+\frac 1 2$$ and $$- \frac 12$$. 
Wolfgang Pauli said that no two electrons could have the same four quantum numbers.  Since there are only two possible values for $$m_s$$, this means that there can only be a up to two electrons in an orbital.
