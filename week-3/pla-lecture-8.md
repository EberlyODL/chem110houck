## Exceptions to Orbital Filling

There are a few exceptions to the order of filling in the transition metals.  I ask that you know two: chromium and copper.  The reason that these are an exception is due the extra stability when a subshell is half-filled or filled.  Since the energies of orbitals become closer together at higher _n_ shells, it becomes more common to see irregularities to the filling pattern.  Learn more in the video below.

## Electron Configuration of Ions

Anions gain electrons to acquire a negative charge.  Cations lose electrons to become positively charged.

### Anions

When adding electrons to an atom, the typical rules apply to the filling order.  Electrons will be placed in the lowest energy orbitals according to the aufbau principle, only two electrons per orbital with opposite spins as Pauli said, and degenerate orbials will be filled singly with parallel spins according to Hund.

**Example:**
> Oxygen (O): $$1s^22s^22p^4$$

> Oxygen anion (O$$^{2-}$$):  $$1s^22s^22p^6$$

### Cations

When removing electrons from orbitals, you take first from the highest n level (outer electrons).  When there are multiple subshells in the highest principle shell, electrons are removed from the orbital with the highest $$\ell$$ value (i.e. If both the 3s and 3p subshells contain electrons, they will be removed from the 3p first because $$\ell$$ = 1 is higher than the 3s where $$\ell$$ = 0.).

For main group elements in my s and p blocks, this is straight forward because electrons will be removed in the order they were added.  In magnesium (below), the electrons are lost from the 3s orbital to give a complete n = 2 shell.  However, for those pesky transition metals, one must be careful.  Because we take from the highest n level, the electrons lost in forming an ion will not be the last added.  Take titanium in the example below.  The highest n orbital filled is the 4s, so we will lose from here first.  The reason the 4s electrons are lost first is complex. Once there are electrons in the 3d shell, it becomes lower in energy than the 4s and will therefore shield the 4s electrons from the nuclear charge. They will be less attracted to the nucleus and be easier to lose. 

**Examples:**
> Magnesium (Mg): $$1s^22s^22p^63s^2$$

> Magnesium ion (Mg$$^{2+}$$): $$1s^22s^22p^6$$

> Titanium (Ti): $$1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^2$$

> Titanium ion (Ti$$^{2+}$$): $$1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^63d^2$$

### Common ions

Most elements form a predictable ion.  The ions formed generally have complete shells (main group s and p blocks) or subshells (transition metals).  The position on the periodic table gives us an easy way to "see" this pattern.  Common ions are listed in the figure to the right from your ebook.  Groups 1, 2, 6, and 8 form just one type of ion.  Many transition metals can form a variety of ions.

## Excited States

Atoms or ions can be excited when they absorb energy.  The absorption of energy causes one or more electrons within the atom to "jump" to a higher energy orbital.  This will change the electron configuration.  There are essentially an infinite number of possible excited states for an atom or ion.  
Excited state electron configurations will still abide by the Pauli exclusion principle where no more than two electrons having opposite spins can occupy an orbital.
These higher energy configurations will, however, violate either the aufbau principle or Hund's rule.


### Violations of the aufbau principle
>Let's take a look at an example that violates the aufbau principle.  The electron configuration of an atom is shown below:
>> $$1s^22s^12p^53p^1$$

>How do we know it is an excited state? 
> >The aufbau principle is violated.  The electrons do not occupy the lowest energy orbitals possible.

>What is the identity of the element?
>> In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons.  So, if we count the total number of electrons, we can identify the element.  In the example above, there are 9 electrons and we can identify the element as fluorine (F).

>What is the ground state configuration?
>> The ground state configuration can be determined by placing all electrons into orbitals according to the aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule.
$$1s^22s^22p^5$$


> How do we write an "excited state" electron configuration?
>>Let's say we're going to write an excited state configuration for silicon (Si).  We have 14 electrons to work with.  The ground state configuration is $$1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^2$$.  First we need to remove one electron from an orbital.  It can be any electron from any orbital!  Let's take a 2p electron.  Then, we add that electron to a higher energy orbital.  Again, any orbital! (Now you can see why there are an infinite number of possibilities! We could even do this for more than one electron!)  I'm going to place it in a 5s orbital.  The excited state configuration I would write is $$1s^22s^22p^53s^23p^25s^1$$.  There are still 14 electrons making it a neutral silicon atom.


### Violations of Hund's rule
Hund's rule violations also result in higher energy electron configurations and therefore are excited states.  The figure below (a) shows that if an electron is paired when other degenerate orbitals are empty, this will be of higher energy (increased electron repulsion).  In b) the unpaired electrons do not have the same spin and is also an excited state.
